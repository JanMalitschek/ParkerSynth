# ParkerSynth
ParkerSynth is a modular synthesizer VST plugin created using C++ and the Juce framework.

## Important
The project, even though usable, is still very much in development and is rather unstable in certain instances.
In case you do want to use it(which I do not reccomend at the moment), please keep that in mind!
